From there I will use the Foursquare API to get a list of venues in the area. We will then cluster the neighborhoods based off of those venues. \n\n   Finally we can look at the clusters and help the entrepreneur pick a location depending on his desired market. \n   - Does she want to be the local stop in a mostly residential area? \n   - Does she want to be in the hustle of a crowded but potentially profitable entertainment district? \n   - Does she want to be a lunch spot for office workers located close buy? \n   \nHopefully the data will help us come to a decision. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
